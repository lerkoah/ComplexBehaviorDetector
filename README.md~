# Complex Behavior Detector - ALMA Summer Job
This is the repository for the project Complex Behavior Detector from alma. This is the Lerko's Summer Job. In this repository I'm going to save the principal scripts and instructions for running the framework in your computer.

## Detectors Classes

### Detectors Type 1
The principal file for this detectors is `DetectorType1.py`. Additionally, You can find tests for this Detectors that you can run in a Job Manager with the following syntax:

```sh
python python -u /home/lerko/Desktop/ComplexBehaviorDetector/DetectorsType1.py DetectorName Priority
```

The argument ``Priority`` can be ommit. For example, if we want to execute Alerting Detector with Priority Alarm ``CRITICAL`` we must to execute:

```sh
python python -u /home/lerko/Desktop/ComplexBehaviorDetector/DetectorsType1.py AlertingDetector CRITICAL
```

The possible alarms level are:

* DEBUG
* INFO
* WARNING
* CRITICAL
